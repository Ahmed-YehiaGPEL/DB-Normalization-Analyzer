# DB-Normalization-Analyzer
**Project Describtion:**

The program aims to automating the process of *Database normalization* through scanning the database design and its function dependency then extracting the erros of the given design or function dependency, suggest solution for each error and suggest a new design.

##Phases of development:

## Phase 1:
1. User inputs the top-down design through importing it in a SQL Workbench format, or through using the built in editor to design a database.
2. User inputs the function dependency using the application special interface for function dependency.
3. The application then scans the given design and function dependcy for errors, and reports them back.
4. The application suggests a solution for each error that doesn't meet the requirments of normalization.

## Phase 2:
1. User inputs the top-down design through either previously mentioned ways.
2. The application creates the function dependcy diagram based on the top-down design, following that the top-down design follows a special naming convention for each entity.
3. The application scans the function dependecy, reports the errors back, suggests a solution and a new database design.

##Phase 3:
1. User inputs the top-down design through either previously mentioned ways.
2. The application creates the function dependecy diagram based on the top-down design **without following any special naming conventions.**
3. The application scans the function dependecy, reports the errors back, suggests a solution and a new database design.
